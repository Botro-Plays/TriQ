## 4. What's Actually Working Right Now

Users can:
1. Visit `https://triq.dpdns.org/login`
2. Sign in with **Phone OTP** (Firebase) or **Google Sign-In**
3. Select role (Passenger/Driver/Staff/Owner)
4. **Passenger**: Book rides, see fare estimates, track active ride, rate/report drivers, emergency button, share ride, view history, rebook (if driver has Pro), view leaderboard
5. **Driver**: Go online/offline, see pending ride requests, accept/counter-offer/decline, manage active ride, view earnings, view leaderboard, see rebook badges
6. **Admin/Owner**: View dashboard with stats (including total fares), manage KYC, drivers, rides, reports, passengers, subscriptions, tips, ratings, strikes, emergencies, system config
7. Logout

---

## 5. Key Architectural Decisions

- **Monetization**: Driver subscriptions (FREE/PRO) + passenger tips — platform never handles ride fares (cash-only, direct passenger→driver)
- **Rebook as subscription perk**: Only available if original driver has ACTIVE subscription; ride request visible only to the preferred driver
- **Leaderboards**: Computed via aggregation queries (no pre-computed rank column), supports week/month/alltime periods
- **Subscription tiers**: Only FREE and PRO (ELITE removed from schema)
- **Admin earnings**: Shows subscription revenue + tip revenue (not ride fares, which are driver cash earnings)
- **Total fares card**: Shows sum of finalFare from completed rides (driver cash earnings audit, not platform revenue)
